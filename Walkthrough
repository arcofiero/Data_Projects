YouTube Data Analytics on AWS

This project performs basic data analytics on YouTube dataset using AWS services like S3, Lambda, Athena and QuickSight.

Data Lake Architecture

The data is stored in a S3 data lake for scalable and cost-efficient storage. S3 buckets are created for raw zone and processed zone. Lambda functions process and transform data from raw into curated datasets for analytics.

Data Ingestion

The raw YouTube data is downloaded from Kaggle in JSON format. The data covers statistics and metadata for thousands of videos.

The files are uploaded to a S3 bucket in raw zone using AWS CLI:

aws s3 cp youtube-data.json s3://raw-youtube-data

Data Processing

A Lambda function is triggered on new files arriving in raw S3 bucket. The function:

Reads the raw JSON data
Extracts relevant fields into a Pandas dataframe
Saves dataframe to parquet format in processed bucket
Python libraries like Pandas, AWS Data Wrangler are used for data processing.

Lambda IAM Role

The Lambda function is assigned an IAM role with S3 and CloudWatch Logs permissions. This allows the function to read from raw bucket and write to processed bucket.

Athena Table

An Athena table is created over the processed S3 data to make it queryable via SQL. The OpenCSV Serde is used to infer schema from the data.

Analytics

QuickSight connects to the Athena table to visualize and find insights from the YouTube data:

Top videos by views, likes, duration
Category-wise statistics
Daily/monthly trends
Dashboards are created in QuickSight to share with stakeholders.

Further analytics could extract usage metrics, predict popular videos, and more.
